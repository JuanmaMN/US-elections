# US elections


This is a personal project where I will be publishing my analyses on US elections done on R studio and Tableau.

The source of all datasets is from [MIT Election Data + Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data)

Code has been uploaded as well for you to view.

Feedback is welcome and appreciated. Please feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Juanma_MN)
